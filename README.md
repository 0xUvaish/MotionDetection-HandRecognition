# MotionDetection-HandRecognition
An object detector that detects motion, records the time of motion and counts and displays the number of human hand fingers in the frame in the real-time(dynamic).

## Getting started
These instructions will help you in starting the project once you have cloned it to your PC.

## Prerequisites
* In order to start the project, you need to have python3 and pip3 present in your PC.

## Setup
* Now open the terminal in the folder where you have cloned this repo and run the following commands.
- `apt-get install python3-opencv`.
- `apt-get install python3-pandas`.
- `pip3 install imutils`.
- `pip3 install sklearn`.
- Now run `python3 motion_time_detection.py` to run the first script.
- And run `python3 hand_recognition.py` to run the second script.


## Description 
- The overall methodology consists of three parts.
- First aims to propose methods for detection of moving objects.
- Second part is in continuation with the first and aims to record time of motion of objects.
- Third, the last part consists of developing methods for recognizing hand fingers and record the counting of fingers.
- The complete project is spans over 2 scripts, first `motion_time_detection.py` and second `python3 hand_recognition.py`.
- Scripts will continue to run until user interruption.
- A research paper is also prepared to publish (in process currently).
